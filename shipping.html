    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for choosing Sunamma’s Kerala Foods & Spices. Below is our Shipping & Delivery Policy to help you understand how and when you’ll receive your order.</p>

    <h2>1. Shipping Locations</h2>
    <p>We currently deliver across India through trusted third-party courier partners. If your pincode is not serviceable, we will notify you after order placement and issue a full refund if needed.</p>

    <h2>2. Dispatch Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Orders are typically dispatched within 2–4 working days from the date of confirmation.</li>
      <li>All products are freshly prepared in small batches, so dispatch timelines may vary slightly during peak seasons or bulk orders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Estimated Delivery Time</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Once dispatched, delivery time usually ranges from <strong>3 to 7 working days</strong>, depending on your location.</li>
      <li>Rural or remote areas may experience slightly longer delivery timelines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Shipping Charges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Shipping charges, if any, will be displayed at checkout before payment.</li>
      <li>We may offer free shipping for promotional periods or above a certain order value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Tracking Your Order</h2>
    <p>Once your order is dispatched, we will share the tracking link via email or WhatsApp. You can use it to monitor your shipment status in real-time.</p>

    <h2>6. Delays or Failed Deliveries</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sunamma’s is not responsible for delays caused by natural disasters, strikes, courier delays, or incorrect address provided by the customer.</li>
      <li>If a delivery is returned due to incorrect address or repeated failed delivery attempts, re-shipping charges may apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Packaging & Quality</h2>
